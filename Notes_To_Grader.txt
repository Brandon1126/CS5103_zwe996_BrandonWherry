I wrote in C++11, big number computation would be incredibly easy with Python,
however I wanted to use this project to become more familiar with C++, as I usually
only write in Java or Python

Things that I will be adding more as I go:
-More comments
-clean up member functions more
-subtraction method is long, may be unavoiable, but will try to reduce as I go
-add chrono timers to see execution times (for fun)
-expand Bignum class to handle ~10 billion digits (right now it's limited up to ~2 billion, in theory, though I havent tried that high yet, only few thousand)
